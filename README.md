# DumE   
Hi, Dum E!

**ABSTRACT**   
This is the project of making Dum-E. And it's still going on. I've commented explanations just for in case I've forgot the code later. To get the point, it would not be that detailed.   

&nbsp; Dum-E version 1 : It has a pan-tilt body without a camera. It can track a face using openCV.   
&nbsp; Dum-E version 2 :
